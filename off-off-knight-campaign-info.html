During this time you have met with other travelers who share your unlikely destination, and you have decided to band together._

_Some of you are high ranking soldiers of the Steel Company, the mercenary army that guards the caravans. The sands of the Muhar desert are becoming overrun with shambling, spore-infested undead and cacti-like brambles that drip a lethal paralytic poison. A squad was sent to investigate and only a single soldier returned. He was sun scorched, near dead, and gibbering mad, but clutched a map made by the squad?s sergeant. Notes on the map describe a never before seen, but ancient temple, seemingly revealed by shifting dunes. The temple seems to be at the center of the infestation._

_Some of you are employed by a wealthy archeologists guild in Duwara, which has heard about the rumored emergence of the fabled Vrunhaja, temple of Gahiji the Wicked and is skeptical of its legitimacy. The guild offers 500gp to investigate the temple and report back to the guild with findings, and the additional offer to purchase any relics the party recovers from inside for a fair price._

_One of you has heard that the temple is the resting place of the powerful Rod of the Scarab Lord. The person who wields the rod is said to summon and control swarms of insects. After hearing about this powerful artifact and about others said to be headed for this temple, you arranged for yourself to be among them._</div></div></div><br/>

And you came across the zombies - horrible bloated things with yellow boils that burst into clouds of foul fungal spores when struck._ 

_One night a great horde struck your camp, at least a hundred of the foul things. You fought for what seemed like hours, until the sun finally rose, illuminating a half acre of torn bloated zombie corpses on the ground, as well as the corpses of all of your mounts and 4 of the mercenaries.  The rising sun also reveals a stunning sight in the distance - a great dark cube shaped structure looms before you just a few miles away._ </div></div></div><br/>
