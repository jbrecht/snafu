I place the armor in the flame for one minute, biting my lip and gauging the elapsed time(very agitated about how long this is taking!) and then quickly strap it back on; I place the daggers in one by one and then come back to the room we were resting in looking around quickly to see if anyone has moved.</div></div></div><br/>

I have been so accustomed to self-reliance that I made a call for the group and that was wrong. I see my action have repercussions: like a pebble skipping across the water. Times, it is glorious, majestic and you feel like it could glide for eternity. Other times is twists and flops, making a large splash. My friend, my companion....I splashed back there but just like the perfect skipping stone, my edges smooth with every wave that crashes. LO! FEAR NOT for I am adept at restorative mojo that will help if you fall but trust in me through the majestic glides and spectacular kerplunks. I will be there for you (deep bow). 
I will be going to never winter to report my findings to my sect and would like a companion if you are willing. As we are getting renoun, we should be doubling up for protection. We?ve let too many escape to not have made some enemies in the world. </div></div></div><br/>

It was a wonderful trap?and we blundered in with little grace.  How can I weave an epic tale to share in performance with my audiences; it?s not exactly heroic...   Yet, I?ve made my own errors.  We are all still learning each other?s tactics, strengths and shortcomings; we are becoming a force to be reckoned with and respected.  Thank you for the explanation?but, there is no need to bow.  Not to me... I do not wish to demean you nor should you allow yourself to be.
I would like to visit Neverwinter also; I need to shop at the Lords Alliance magic shop and see what may aid us in our next task. I also wish to procure some fine Elvish rope, maybe some restorative potions and inks.  I would like to study map making and perhaps look into information about some acquaintances from my past.

Have you ever read of altering spell results by direct energy manipulation?  I mean to create an effect that is considerably different, not just more powerful, but...customized?  I have been having odd ?dreams? while meditating...like I was being guided or shown subtle ways to alter the energies I tap into while casting spells.  The spells reacted very differently from what I?ve known...  I could almost see how a subtle twist to a gesture or change in verbal inflections would influence or enhance my spell work...I just am not quite able to ?see? the correct gesture or inflections?what I do understand seems to melt away as I leave my meditations.  I have only this vague recall of being able to do this. Have you read of this or is it even possible do you think??</div></div></div><br/>

You lads remember when I got terrified by that floating eye thing. I couldn?t even move - it was horrible. It was that night the dreams started. I dreamed that I was about to kill a man in cold blood. I was standing right at the foot of his bed as he lay sleeping. I knew right then, that if I did this thing, I was damned. It could never be undone.  And that?s when I woke up.

The dream fades and the crushing weight of reality drives me from my bed to the floor. That dream is just history and the deed has long been done. I am damned. I began crawling on the wooden floor following a line in the floorboard to the wall. That act gave me respite and I traced the line below back to the opposite wall. Hours passed this way. 

That weight and the weight of countless more I?ve slayed still drives me to my knees and makes me crawl. If I follow the lines long enough I will sleep.

No, no. It?s ok.

The fire, the hammer, the pounding...they too give me respite.  Forging and shaping the blades keep those nights at bay. 

I?m alright, really.</div></div></div><br/>

It can be wonderful to feel the heavy weight of gold in those pockets.  But...gold has no warmth to give.  The memory of what it cost you and others?it can weigh you down with questions and doubts also.  Did they deserve death?  What dreams did they have?  Was it right?  Those questions can be heavy too?filling you with regret; where do you draw YOUR line?  Where does this line lead you?  To more killings?  Killing is a part of nature; it?s necessary for us to survive...but killing should mean something more than just a pile of coins to buy some ale to drown your memories in.  It should buy a path out of the darkness rather than just hiring someone to keep you company for a single night; a companion that will leave you alone when the time is up.  Maybe, if the killing was justified...maybe, if it made a difference to the greater world it would be easier to live with in the depths of the night...?</div></div></div><br/>

As you approach the door to the spell forge it appears to be locked.  A bright light is protruding from the bottom of the door and you can hear spell incantations being spoken.  After a few minutes the incantations subside as the light from beneath the door grows dimmer and dimmer finally turning back into the green hue of which you recognize as the spell forges normal glow.  The door opens and you find Lisamar pale white and exhausted sitting in a chair.  Next to the spell forge stands a staff with 3 prismatic crystals inlaid in the top, their colors shift and change in a random succession.  "How are you friend?" he asks "I am happy to see you came so quickly."  He makes a few arcane hand gestures and the door to his mansion opens in front of him.  "Please, join me for some tea." he says as he enters the door.  You follow him and sit down.  Your favorite beer is provided instead of tea.  "In making an item of such raw power I need to channel magic from all 8 schools into it.  As I am not as practiced in divination magics I use a divination stone."  He pulls out a piece of cloth from his satchel and opens it up revealing a yellow and white finely cut gem.  "Four days ago I reached in and grabbed the stone only to be bombarded by a horrible vision.  I saw Tiamat, the Queen of Dragons, rising out of Avernus.  She swept from city to city all throughout the Faerun leaving nothing but destruction in her wake.  She then went on to conquer the other continent of this world."  He looks at you with a serious eye.    "At the end of the vision there was a dark figure standing in her way.  He was overflowing in necrotic energy.  As the vision of the figure became more clear I saw that the figure was you Bromrig."  Just repeating the story of the vision leaves his looking scared.  "I wish to make a bargain with you.  Do what you can to stop this Rise of Tiamat and I will do all that is in my power to help you uncover whatever necrotic powers lay beneath your manor.  For if you do not succeed stopping her rise you may be the only one who can save us."  The color begins to re turn to his face as he drinks his tea.  "Give me four fortnights to study and research this necrotic energy and in the meantime you do what you can to put a stop to this calamity from happening."  he extends his hand and says "Do we have an accord."</div></div></div><br/>

?Greetings Viscountess, 
First, let me say I?m honored at your continued support of my advancement in the Lords Alliance, though, your friendship is something I treasure even more deeply.  I have good friends in my fellowship with the Phireballs, yet...men are difficult to understand and my past experiences make it hard to get too close.  Thank you for your advice; it has been full of wisdom and has never failed me.  The agreement between the Lords Alliance and the Zhenturim was difficult to forge, but I think what has been agreed upon will satisfy both sides and allow us to work together to remove a great threat to the Faerun in the form of the Dragon Cultists.  Whatever threat we face in them, at least we can now know we won?t have the Zhenturim stabbing us in the back while we fight!  This meeting raised another concern in my mind as I waited to learn the outcome.  The Phandalin Phireballs have become well known, certainly the Dragon Cultists know of us...but what of the Dragons we?ve slain?  Will they not seek revenge?  Our home is well known and their thirst for vengeance is growing I?m sure.  What means do we have for fortifying Phandalin against a vengeful dragon?  Are heavy ballista in place on the walls surrounding Phandalin?  Do we have enough archers or even a spellcaster in place? I wish for no loss of life on my hands for not preparing to defend our people!  

P.S.  Baron Sambridge is a rather odious fellow;  overly ambitious, and I sense a mind that is quick to judge unfairly?I?ve known men like him in my past.  Perhaps I?m wrong or allow my past to color my perceptions too much, but I wanted to pass along my thoughts of him.  He is no Halia Whetzil!

Your faithful servant,

Lewin</div></div></div><br/>

"I must offer my gratitude for all of your perserverance to this cause. I may not have been forthcoming as to the purpose of our quest, or what has driven me to this point. Your companionship this far is exemplary, and worthy of even a King's tribute, far more than a Mayor can afford.

We sit now at the edge of the Ruins of Archemount, where stands the portal to the Tower I seek.  It is a strange tale to tell, of how I, or we, came to this quest.  Perhaps it was chance, or luck, (good or bad I'm not yet sure), but the Manor which I purchased in order to house our brotherhood, seems was once owned by someone with answers to questions deeper than I had earlier ever imagined.  Through my studies in the caverns, and following leads from there on, have come to seek this fathomless knowledge held by a once powerful wizard. His name is not spoken these days, but he has left a legacy which, if we can wield wisely, should aid us in our quests.

I quiver with anxiousness to uncover what further secrets he has left behind. But I understand that these ancient tomes and items are not what you all seek.

What lies ahead could be our most dangerous adversary yet. Umbraxar, the Eclipse of Death, is said to guard the ruins. He was once a Green Dragon, but time in the Shadowfell may have turned him to a Shadow Dragon. I know that I cannot defeat this guardian on my own, and I ask for your assistance. And in return, I offer my own succour to each of you, to aid you in your quests, to the best of my abilities.

In the chamber of the Well of Passage, the demand of a sacrifice was made. I made no offer at that time.  I am of free will, and would rather perish than be made a slave to another being. However, on retrospect, I am willing to make some surrender of my person, for the longer gain of our purpose, and our friendship. Should you witness me make such a choice, do not fear that I have relinquished hold on my sanity. On the contrary, my body is just the shell that holds my indomitable spirit, and any contribution of this husk to another will only be made with the understanding of the gift I shall receive in its stead.

I know there lie treasures beyond this portal. (Gallo, some are said to be guarded with death magic.) Therein also lie the tools I can use to help us to, if nothing else, fight Tiamat and her soldiers. This legacy was written for me on pages I have read with my own eyes.  Alone, that legacy could be something far less remarkable.  But with this group, these Phireballs, true greatness is yet to come.  May I have your hands, to join, before we climb to our greatest challenge?"</div></div></div><br/>

I say, when we all dropped down into that pyramid into the unknown, it was the second time I thought to myself, ?Rynny, you sure did lead these people,  hells...your new kin right into certain demise. Promising them protection with your life...for whatever that?s worth. And it could have been nothing. Poof! Like kicking a dandelion and scattering to the winds never to be seen again. And y?all BELIEVED me when I say trust me and walked into the unknown right behind (looks at dauntless: ?well...sometimes in front like a big old twister blowing through a village) but call came with me so I have no other choice than to come with y?all. I mean hells, because y?all walked with me, I was able to walk with countless warriors on the front lines of the war. Every life I saved, every hatchling that wandered into the foxes holler that I got back home safe wouldn?t have seen their kin, their brethren with me and I wouldn?t have been there without y?all. Like it or not, we are bound to each other. Connected spiritually through the weaving of the universe. Who an I do deny that awesome influence for my personal lust for breathing. Hells, wouldn?t I be grand to find out what?s on the other side with the finest of the flock?? 
Just remember that evil can never be fully controlled  but if we can whip it back at the bigger beast, it?s good to have some tricks up our sleeves.

It was then she noticed Hetro swing about to her right, around  and behind Domthon, and with his shield hand on Domthon's shoulder, stabbed his sword through his back and heart. She looked at the ugly blue face as the blade forced its way though his chest, the tip surrounded by a faint white-blue glow as it pushed through.

Domthon's eyes rolled back in his head as life escaped him, he slid down Hetro's sword as the paladin lowered it. The body slumped at the ice around Rohkemira's feet, but her anger didn't dissipate. She'd seen Bula float up in the river behind her moments ago, eyes closed, and knew it wasn't finished. In her rage she began smashing at the ice at her feet. Domthon's head obstructed on a few swings but after two hacks the red spray was all over the ice and the third cracked enough for the right foot to free. She leapt towards Bula, took a deep breath, whispered a prayer to Ulthera and placed her hand on Bula's forehead. "Spare her."

Bula coughed up some water. Hetro exhaled, kicked the hobgolin off his sword and saw the pair in the water, dropped his sword, and waded in. He grabbed Bula by her cloak, pulled her head towards the shore, sat himself on the edge, and laid her head on his lap, her armor keeping her body afloat on the water. He closed his eyes, his lips spoke "Protandis, hers is a life lived free. She shall live free more." Hetro's hands glowed, with the same white blue sheen as the sword moments before, one on Bula's head, the other her shoulder.

"ccaaAaah!" Bula awoke with a start. She stood, half submerged in water, looking at Hetro. "Thank you."

Hetro responded, "No, thank you." He grasped her hand, and helped her out of the water.</div></div></div><br/>
